# The Cart-Pole Swing-Up Environment

This repository contains one CartPole SwingUp [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment from the [WANN paper](https://weightagnostic.github.io/) and one adaptation of that environment.

The original environment code is [here](https://github.com/google/brain-tokyo-workshop/blob/master/WANNRelease/WANNTool/custom_envs/cartpole_swingup.py).

The adaptation made is to produce a discrete version of the original environment from [here](https://github.com/jfpettit/cartpole-swingup-envs).
